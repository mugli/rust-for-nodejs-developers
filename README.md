# Rust for Node.js Developers (work in progress ðŸ˜Š)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

This guide full of examples is intended for people learning Rust that are coming from Node.js, although the vice versa can work too. I made this because I'm learning Rust myself, hoping maybe it'll also help other people with similar background and interest. I tried to learn idiomatic rust along the way, but please feel free to send PR if you find something that can be improved.

## Examples

All sample code is available in [examples/](examples/)

Use `cargo-script` for running Rust `.rs` codes:

```bash
# Install cargo-script
cargo install cargo-script

# Run filename.rs
cargo script filename.rs
```

_Note: Sometimes the Rust source will have comment like this:_

```rust
// cargo-deps: time="0.1.25"
```

_This is only to let `cargo script` know that it needs to download `version 0.1.25` of [`time` crate](https://crates.io/crates/time) before running the file. You don't need that comment in a Rust project file created with `cargo new` command._

### comments

---

#### Node.js

```js
// This is a line comment

/*
  This is a block comment
*/
```

#### Rust

````rust

/// Documentation comments look like this and support markdown notation.
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5
/// ```
///
/// Documentation comments must come before what they document.
/// The code will not compile if we place this comment inside the function!
fn main() {
    // This is a line comment
    // that extend multiple lines like this.

    /*
      Note that Rust supports block comment too, but line comments are preferred in general.
    */
}

````

### printing

---

#### Node.js

```js
console.log('hello world');
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
console.log('hello %d %s', 5, 'worlds');
```

Output

```bash
hello world
hello world
hello 5 worlds
```

#### Rust

`println!` is a [macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html)

```rust

fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
    println!("hello {}", "world");
    println!("hello {} {}", 5, "worlds");
}

```

Output

```bash
hello world
hello world
hello 5 worlds
```
