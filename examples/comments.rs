/// Documentation comments look like this and support markdown notation.
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5
/// ```
///
/// Documentation comments must come before what they document. 
/// The code will not compile if we place this comment inside the function!
fn main() {

      Note that Rust supports block comment too, but line comments are preferred in general.
